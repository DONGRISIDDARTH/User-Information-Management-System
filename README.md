# User-Information-Management-System

**Overview**
This project is a full-stack CRUD application designed for managing user entries, including name, email, and address. It allows users to add, update, retrieve, and delete their data through a simple interface. This application follows the MERN stack architecture (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), providing both the backend API and frontend interface for efficient user management.

**Features**
Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Functionality: Users can create new entries, update existing ones, view details, and delete them.

RESTful API: The backend provides a REST API to perform CRUD operations on user data. It is built using Express and Node.js.

Dynamic React Frontend: The frontend is built with React, using dynamic forms and state management for a smooth user experience.

MongoDB Data Storage: MongoDB is used to store user data, providing a flexible and scalable database solution.

Responsive User Interface: The React frontend communicates with the backend API to manage data and update the user interface in real-time.

**Tools & Technologies Used**
Frontend: React.js

Backend: Node.js with Express.js

Database: MongoDB

State Management: React state management for handling dynamic form inputs and user data

HTTP Communication: Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests to the backend
